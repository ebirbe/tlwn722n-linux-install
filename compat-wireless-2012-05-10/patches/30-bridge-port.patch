The patch titled:

    bridge: use rx_handler_data pointer to store net_bridge_port pointer
   
by Jiri Pirko <jpirko@redhat.com> moved the br_ports pointer
out of the netdev which older kernels relied on and then added
a flag to the netdev to check for it as follows:

-                               dev->br_port) {
+                   (dev->priv_flags & IFF_BRIDGE_PORT)) {

So to backport this we instead rely on a br_port_exists() call
which compat.git provides and depending on the kernel it will either
check for the dev->br_port or the IFF_BRIDGE_PORT flag. A patch
to get the blow code merged upstream and to use br_port_exists()
everywhere else will be submitted but not sure if it will be
accepted.

This patch can be removed once we get br_port_exists() accessible
to drivers and not just private bridge code. If that patch doesn't
get accepted upstream we'l have to carry this patch around for
compat-wireless.
